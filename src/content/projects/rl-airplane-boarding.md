[![RL Airplane Boarding Live Simulation](/assets/projects/rl-airplane-boarding.png)](https://github.com/stericishere/RL-for-airplane-onboarding)

A reinforcement learning solution for optimizing airplane passenger boarding sequences using Maskable PPO to minimize congestion and reduce boarding time by 75%.

---

## üéØ Project Overview

This project tackles the complex problem of airplane boarding optimization using deep reinforcement learning. The agent learns to intelligently select which passenger groups (by row) to board next, **achieving a 75% reduction in passenger stalling** compared to random boarding and minimizing total boarding time through optimal sequencing strategies.

The live simulation above shows the RL agent in action, with color-coded passengers (green = moving/selected, red = stalled, orange = stowing luggage, yellow = waiting in lobby) and real-time statistics tracking the boarding progress.

## üß† Core RL Components

### 1. Agent State Representation

The agent observes a **flattened state vector** containing:

```python
# State space: (num_seats * 2,) = (50,) for 10 rows √ó 5 seats
observation_space = Box(low=-1, high=49, shape=(50,), dtype=np.int32)
```

**State Encoding:**
- **Passenger Position**: Each boarding line position contains 2 values:
  - `[seat_number, status_value]` for occupied positions
  - `[-1, -1]` for empty positions
- **Passenger Status Values:**
  - `0` = MOVING (passenger progressing through aisle)
  - `1` = STALLED (blocked by passenger ahead)
  - `2` = STOWING (storing luggage overhead)

**Example State:**
```
[5, 1, 12, 0, -1, -1, 23, 2, ...]
# Passenger with seat 5 is STALLED
# Passenger with seat 12 is MOVING
# Empty position
# Passenger with seat 23 is STOWING luggage
```

### 2. Reward Calculation

The reward system incentivizes efficient boarding by **penalizing congestion**:

```python
def _calculate_reward(self):
    reward = -self.boarding_line.num_passengers_stalled() + self.boarding_line.num_passengers_stowing()
    return reward
```

**Reward Structure:**
- **Negative Reward** = -(Number of stalled passengers)
- **Optimal Goal**: Minimize passenger stalling to maximize reward
- **Typical Range**: -20 to 0 per step (fewer stalled passengers = higher reward)

**Strategic Implications:**
- Agent learns to avoid creating bottlenecks
- Encourages boarding passengers whose seats are readily accessible
- Balances between filling seats efficiently vs. avoiding aisle congestion

### 3. Why Maskable PPO?

**Traditional PPO Limitations:**
- Can select invalid actions (boarding from empty lobby rows)
- Wastes training time on impossible moves
- Slower convergence due to invalid action exploration

**Maskable PPO Advantages:**
```python
def action_masks(self) -> list[bool]:
    mask = []
    for row in self.lobby.lobby_rows:
        if len(row.passengers) == 0:
            mask.append(False)  # Invalid: no passengers to board
        else:
            mask.append(True)   # Valid: passengers available
    return mask
```

- **Action Masking**: Prevents selection of invalid actions (empty lobby rows)
- **Efficient Exploration**: Focuses learning on valid boarding decisions only
- **Faster Convergence**: Eliminates wasted training on impossible actions
- **Guaranteed Validity**: All selected actions are executable in the environment

### 4. Vectorized and Parallel Training

**Training Configuration:**
```python
env = make_vec_env(
    AirplaneEnv,
    n_envs=12,  # 12 parallel environments
    env_kwargs={"num_of_rows": 10, "seats_per_row": 5},
    vec_env_cls=SubprocVecEnv  # Multi-process execution
)
```

**Performance Benefits:**
- **12x Faster Data Collection**: Parallel episode execution
- **Improved Sample Efficiency**: Diverse experiences from multiple environments
- **Better Generalization**: Training across varied boarding scenarios simultaneously
- **Stable Learning**: Reduced variance through batch experience collection

**Training Parameters:**
- **Entropy Coefficient**: `ent_coef=0.05` (encourages exploration)
- **Policy**: MlpPolicy (Multi-layer Perceptron)
- **Device**: CPU-optimized for multi-process stability

### 5. TensorBoard Training Analysis

The training metrics demonstrate robust learning and convergence:

#### üìà Mean Episode Reward

![Mean Episode Reward](/assets/projects/rl-airplane/Mean-Episode-Reward.png)

**Interpretation:** ‚úÖ **Excellent Learning Progress**
- Average reward per episode during training rollouts
- **Improvement**: -160 to -40 (75% reduction in passenger stalling)
- **Convergence**: Stable plateau around -40 after 3M steps
- **Significance**: Agent successfully learned to minimize congestion

#### üîß Explained Variance

![Explained Variance](/assets/projects/rl-airplane/explained-variance.png)

**Interpretation:** ‚úÖ **Good Value Function Learning**
- How well the value function predicts returns (R¬≤ metric)
- **Range**: 0.65-0.75 (solid predictive capability)
- **Meaning**: Value function explains ~70% of return variance
- **Stability**: Consistent performance throughout training

#### ‚úÇÔ∏è Clip Fraction

![Clip Fraction](/assets/projects/rl-airplane/cliped-fraction.png)

**Interpretation:** ‚úÖ **Healthy Policy Updates**
- Fraction of policy updates clipped by PPO's surrogate objective
- **Initial**: 0.18 (active exploration)
- **Later**: 0.11 (conservative, stable updates)
- **Trend**: Decreasing clip fraction indicates policy stabilization

#### üìè Approximate KL Divergence

![KL Divergence](/assets/projects/rl-airplane/KL-Divergence.png)

**Interpretation:** ‚úÖ **Controlled Policy Changes**
- **Range**: 0.015-0.025 (moderate policy updates)
- **Stability**: Consistent KL values throughout training
- **Safety**: Within safe range (<0.1) for stable learning
